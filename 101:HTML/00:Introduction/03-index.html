    This SHOULD be added to the beginning of every MODERN HTML Document.

    However, The declaration is not an HTML tag. 
    It is an "information" to the browser or program reading the document
    about what document type to expect.

    !DOCTYPE tells the program reading the document what this document is
    going to contain, and therefore, how to treat it's content. 

    There are other types other than html we can use here, but we will not
    discuss them just yet. For example, XML, which, would cause the browser
    to behave quite differently than for html. 
    
    For now, remember to include this at the top of every html page that 
    you create - ever. It's good practice. 

    If you forget, it's not really a big deal in most cases, but, there might
    be rare cases where something doesn't work as you expect because you don't 
    
    use it. Experienced developers may 'snub' their noses at you if you forget
    it to often, and if you see another developer not including it - remind 
    them that it really does matter!
    
    Rule #1 
    - Use <!DOCTYPE html> in every HTML document
    - See: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp

-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

    HTML Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    
        * Hyper - meaning, the 'thing' does something
        * Text - meaning, it is written in human readable text
        * Markup - meaning, it describes it's content
        * Language - meaning, it has a syntax, a way of speaking.

    It was invented by a guy at 'Cern' who needed to solve some big
    problems at the time. 

    But, before we tell you what those problems are, you must remember

        * At this time there was NO Internet, Google, Yahoo or anything
            like that, they came much much later. 
            
        * The Closest Thing we had to the internet was a bunch of networks
            that were disjointed - networks like Cyclades, Telenet, NPL 
            Network, Bitnet and the precurser to the internet, Arpanet.
            
        * Most people would dial directly into other user, company or 
            universty BBS Systems and there was no such thing as a Web
            Browser, usually only Terminals or 'TelNet'

        * Most people didn't own computers still and Mainframes were the
            most powerful computer of the day (and precursor to todays
            modern super computers and many operating systems)
