    <!-- Rule: 16 - We can specify the 'language' our HTML document represents with various country codes, which
                    we will cover in more detail later. This one sets it to English. It does NOT translate the
                    document but it is useful to tell Search Engines what language this document is presented in. 
    -->
    <html  lang="en">    
        <head>
            <title>My First Web Page</title>
            <!-- Rule #17 - the meta element is another non visual element, it belongs in head and can take different
                attributes that help to further describe how the program should treat the document, this is especially
                important for search engines and browsers or archival programs, text readers and accessability devices
                that use HTML 
            -->
            
            <!-- Rule #18 - Here we add a Description for our Website, this is useful to Google for Example-->            
            <meta name="description" content="This is a description of my first website"> 
            <!---Rule #19 - Here we are defining what is known as the 'character set' for the document.                 
                Different languages have different symbols, for example, Mandarin and Koren, English and 
                Arabic, Latin and Greet, we will cover this in ore detail later -->
            <meta charset="UTF-8">

            <!-- Here are even more tags that are used inside the 'Head' of the HTML document that are non visual but
                provide important information to the browser or program on how to deal with this document. Not all
                need to be used all the time but it makes good practice to include them and also makes sure that your
                document (especially in web browsers) continues to behave as you want and expect it to. Some are used
                to override the 'default' behaviour of most browser, while others, are for SEO purposes, each have
                their use - which we will cover later
            -->
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <!-- sets the width to width of browser window and scale to 1.0 -->
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"> <!-- is used to important a CSS stylesheet, we will cover this later -->
            <script src="script.js"></script> <!-- is used to import a script, in this case, a javascript file, we'll cover this later -->
