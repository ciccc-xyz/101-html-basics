<!-- Rule #1 
    - Use <!DOCTYPE html> in every HTML document
    - See: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp
-->
<!DOCTYPE html> 

<!-- Rule #2 - The html tag comes after the DOCTYPE tag-->
<html> <!-- 'root element' -->

    <!-- Rule #3 - The Head Tag 'should' appear right after the HTML tag, but its order doesn't matter, however, it helps with SEO -->
    <head></head> <!-- Document 'Head'. It contains extra information about this page. -->

    <!-- Rule #4 - The Body Tag 'should' appear right after the Head tag, but its order doesn't matter, however, it helps with SEO -->
    <body></body> <!-- Document 'Body'. It contains the actual information on this page -->    

    <!-- Tip #1: The Reason it Matters what order you do it in is because a Browser or Program will read your web page from TOP to BOTTOM
        and since the 'head' section 'describes' the extra information 'about' the page, and the body desctibes the 'actual' information
        search robots like 'google' may only 'skim' your website until they read the 'head' section, and if it appears 'first' at the top
        of each HTML document, then, it will be 'read quicker' by the Web Crawlers which index the internet, and that's a good thing for 
        SEO ranking, as the faster a site responds to the Web Crawlers, the better its performance ranking will be

   HTML Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    
   It was invented in the late 1980s by a British computer scientist named 
   Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who was working at the European Organization for Nuclear 
   Research (CERN) at the time.

    Remember
        * At this time there was NO Internet, Google, Yahoo or anything
            like that, they came much much later. 
            
        * The Closest Thing we had to the internet was a bunch of networks
            that were disjointed - networks like Cyclades, Telenet, NPL 
            Network, Bitnet and the precurser to the internet, Arpanet.
            
        * Most people would dial directly into other user, company or 
            universty BBS Systems and there was no such thing as a Web
            Browser, usually only Terminals or 'TelNet'

        * Most people didn't own computers still and Mainframes were the
            most powerful computer of the day (and precursor to todays
            modern super computers and many operating systems)

    Berners-Lee was looking for a way to make it easier for scientists to 
    share information and collaborate on research projects, and he came 
    up with the idea of creating a hypertext system that would allow users
    to access and navigate information by clicking on links within a 
    document. He called his invention the World Wide Web, and he wrote 
    first web browser and web server software to make it possible.

    The first version of HTML, known as HTML 1.0, was released in 1993, 
    and it included just a handful of tags for formatting text and creating
    links. 
    
    As the web grew in popularity, HTML evolved to include more features,
    such as tables, forms, and multimedia content, and new versions of the 
    language were released to keep pace with the changing needs of web developers.

    HTML has played a crucial role in the evolution of the internet, as it has
    provided the standard syntax for creating web pages that can be viewed on any
     device with a web browser. 
     
    Without HTML, it would be much more difficult to share information and 
    collaborate online, and the internet as we know it today would not exist.
