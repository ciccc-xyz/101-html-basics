# HTML Resume Assignment

## Assignment Description

Welcome to the HTML Resume Assignment! Your task is to create an online resume using HTML. Your resume should include your name, interests, date of birth, education, work experience, and a general cover letter to employers. You can add a little CSS and a little JavaScript if you have experience with them, but the focus here is HTML.

Make sure to use appropriate HTML tags, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. You can refer to the [W3Schools HTML tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) for guidance and inspiration.

From time to time at the start we will make use of reliable sources of information such as
developer documentation. This documentation can be quite 'terse' sometimes, or difficult to
read at first and contains alot of data that the typical beginner doesn't need right away. 
So for now, we will reference W3 Schools which is a simpler but equally consistent reference
for HTML, JS, CSS (and other languages). It is suitable for beginners.
