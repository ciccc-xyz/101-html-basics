Summary: HTML as a Markup Language coupled with Javascript as a Programming Language

While HTML is not a programming language, it can be used in conjunction with programming languages like JavaScript
to create more dynamic and functional web pages.

JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to create interactive web pages. 
    JavaScript code is contained within HTML tags called script tags. 
    These script tags tell the browser to execute the JavaScript code contained within them.

For example, you might use JavaScript to create a button on a webpage that changes the color of a paragraph when 
it's clicked. 

Here's an example of what that might look like:

    <button onclick="document.getElementById('my-paragraph').style.color = 'red'">Click Me!</button>
    <p id="my-paragraph">This is a paragraph.</p>

In this example, the button tag is used to create a button on the webpage. 
    The onclick attribute tells the browser to execute the JavaScript code contained within 
    the quotes when the button is clicked. 
    
    In this case, the JavaScript code changes the color of the paragraph with an id of my-paragraph 
    to red.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my web page!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <button onclick="alert('Hello, world!')">Click me</button>
    <script>
      // This is a JavaScript function that is executed when the button is clicked
      function myFunction() {
        alert("Hello, world!");
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
