   The first web page ever created is still accessible on the internet today, 
    -   and it was written by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.
    -   it was also written on a NeXT Computer, which, has a very interesting history
        itself and is related to the history of Apple, Steve Jobs and the modern 
        mac operating system on Laptops, Tablets and IPhones today. 

    The first web page was written in HTML and was created while Berners-Lee was 
    working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in 1990. 
    
    The web page was designed to be a simple explanation of the World Wide Web and
    how it worked, and it included hyperlinks to other pages on the web.

    The first web page did not have any graphics or images, and it was mainly composed
    of text. 
    
    The page was hosted on a NeXT computer at CERN and was made publicly available on 
    August 6, 1991.

    Here's a link to a version of the first web page that is still available on the internet 
        today: http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.
