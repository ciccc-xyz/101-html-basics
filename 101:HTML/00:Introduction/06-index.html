   HTML, the markup language used to create web pages, was based on the Standard Generalized 
   Markup Language (SGML). SGML was a metalanguage, or language for defining markup languages, 
   that was developed in the 1980s to solve a problem that had been plaguing the publishing 
   industry for decades.

    Prior to SGML, publishers used a variety of different markup languages to mark up their 
    documents for printing, which made it difficult to exchange information between different 
    computer systems and led to a proliferation of incompatible file formats. 
    
    SGML was designed to provide a common, standardized way of marking up documents that would 
    allow information to be exchanged more easily and reliably.

    HTML was developed as a subset of SGML specifically for use on the World Wide Web. 
    
    It was designed to provide a simple, easy-to-use markup language that would allow web 
    developers to create and publish web pages without needing a deep understanding of SGML.

    While SGML was well-suited for complex publishing applications, it was not ideal for the 
    more lightweight, dynamic web pages that were becoming increasingly popular in the 1990s. 
    
    HTML was designed to be simpler and more accessible than SGML, with a smaller set of tags 
    and a more forgiving syntax that made it easier to write and maintain web pages.

    In short, SGML solved the problem of incompatible markup languages in the publishing 
    industry, while HTML solved the problem of creating a standardized markup language for 
    the World Wide Web that was simple and easy to use. 
    
    While SGML was not suitable for the needs of the web, its influence can still be seen in 
    HTML and other markup languages that are used today.

    See 06-index-sgml-sample in this repo for a sample of an sgml document.
