Summary: HTML as a Markup Language coupled with CSS - Cascading Style Sheets - to handle design

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. 

It's a language used to style and format HTML content on a webpage. 
    CSS is used to define things like colors, fonts, spacing, and layout on a webpage.

CSS works by using selectors to target HTML elements on a webpage and apply styles to them. 
    Selectors can be used to target specific elements, groups of elements, or even elements 
    based on their position on the webpage.

  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
    <style>
      /* This is a CSS rule that changes the background color of the page */
      body {
        background-color: lightblue;
      }
      
      /* This is a CSS rule that changes the font size and color of the heading */
      h1 {
        font-size: 24px;
        color: white;
      }
