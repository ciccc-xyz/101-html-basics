    HTML has a long a very interesting history and it is tied
    very closly with the development and evolution of the modern
    internet you know today and is vital for it's future.

    HTML Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language

    To understand what that really is though, you have to look
    closely at the words, later, we will explore what they 
    really mean and see them in action, for now though;

        * Hyper - meaning, the 'thing' does something
        * Text - meaning, it is written in human readable text
        * Markup - meaning, it describes it's content
        * Language - meaning, it has a syntax, a way of speaking.

    The HTML you see above, will work in any browser of any age.
    
    This is because the HTML Standard is Backward Compatible    
    -- as much as possible that is.

    Older Browsers do not support newer HTML, because they don't
    know what to do with it, usually, they will ignore it. Often
    causing the website not to function correctly, but newer HTML
    still works fundamentally exactly the same way it did decades 
    ago - and you will be glad that it does, because there is a
    wealth of information available to help you. 

    But, you should know;
    - HTML is not THE Beginning
    -- it was one of Many Beginnings.
