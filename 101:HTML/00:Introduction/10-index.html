-->


<!-- Rule #1 - Use <!DOCTYPE html>-->
<!-- Rule #2 - The html tag-->
<!-- Rule #3 - The Head Tag between html tags-->
<!-- Rule #4 - The Body Tag after the head tag-->
<!-- Rule #5 - The Title tag in the Head Tag-->
<!-- Rule #6 - All Visual Tags in Body -->
<!-- Rule #7 - H1,H2...H6 are 'Headings', -->        
<!-- Rule #8 - P is a paragraph,-->        
<!-- Rule #9 - White Space, Enter Key, New Lines are all Ignore, as are comments!-->
<!-- Rule #10 - br inserts a line break, it doens't need to be 'terminated'-->
<!-- Rule #11 - a inserts a link and needs a href attribute with a 'url'-->
<!-- Rule #12 - <button> inserts a button-->
<!-- Rule #13 - <input> inserts a input box-->
<!-- Rule #14 - <section> groups things in a section-->
<!-- Rule #15 - <div> divides things up-->
<!-- Rule:#16 - We can specify the 'language' our HTML document represents with various country codes, which
                we will cover in more detail later. This one sets it to English. It does NOT translate the
                document but it is useful to tell Search Engines what language this document is presented in. 
-->
<!-- Rule #17 - the meta element is another non visual element, it belongs in head and can take different
                attributes that help to further describe how the program should treat the document, this is especially
                important for search engines and browsers or archival programs, text readers and accessability devices
                that use HTML 
-->

<!-- Rule #18 - Here we add a Description for our Website, this is useful to Google for Example-->            
<!-- Rule #19 - Here we are defining what is known as the 'character set' for the document.                 
                Different languages have different symbols, for example, Mandarin and Koren, English and 
                Arabic, Latin and Greet, we will cover this in ore detail later -->

<!-- Rule #20 - link tag is used linking to other resources, in this case, a css document-->
<!-- Rule #21 - script tag is used linking to import a script, in this case, a javascript document-->
<!-- Rule #22 - there are MANY types of tag and tag attribute combinations you can use in the head section and for 
                many different reasons, not all are used all the time -->
