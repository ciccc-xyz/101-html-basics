   Markdown and markup are both methods of formatting text in documents, 
        with markup being a more general term that refers to any system 
        of using tags or symbols to indicate formatting or structure.

    Markup languages, such as HTML, use tags or symbols to indicate 
    formatting or structure, such as bold or italic text, headings, 
    paragraphs, and lists. 
    
    These tags are embedded within the text and are interpreted by 
    software programs to display the text with the desired formatting.

    Markdown, on the other hand, is a lightweight markup language that uses 
    simple text formatting syntax to indicate formatting or structure. 
    
    For example, to make a word bold in Markdown, you would surround it 
    with double asterisks (**). 
    
    This syntax is easy to read and write in plain text, and Markdown can 
    be converted to HTML or other formats using software tools.

    To markup or markdown a document means to add formatting or structure 
    to it using markup or markdown language. 
    
    This can be done manually using a text editor or other software that 
    supports markup languages, or it can be done automatically using 
    software tools that can convert plain text into formatted documents.

    There are many different markup and markdown languages, each with its
    own syntax and set of features. 
    
    Some examples of markup languages include HTML, XML, and LaTeX, while 
    examples of markdown languages include Markdown, reStructuredText, and
    AsciiDoc.

    There are metalanguages, or languages for making languages, that are 
    used to create markup or markdown languages. 
    
    For example, Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a metalanguage 
    that was used to create HTML, and YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML) is a 
    metalanguage that can be used to create lightweight markup languages like 
    Markdown.
