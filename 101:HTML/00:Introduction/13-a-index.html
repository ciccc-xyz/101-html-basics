Summary: HTML as a Markup Language

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
It's a markup language used to create web pages and web applications. 
    HTML is not a programming language, but rather a markup language used to structure content on a webpage.
    HTML works by using tags to define the different types of content that appear on a webpage. 
    Tags are used to define headings, paragraphs, images, and links, among other things.

For example, to create a heading and button on a webpage, you might use the following HTML code:
    
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<button>This is a button</button>

In this example, the h1 tag is used to create a heading on the webpage. 
The text "This is a Heading" is what's displayed on the webpage, and the h1 tag tells the browser that this
text should be formatted as a heading. The same thing holds true for the button. 

It's important to note that HTML is not a programming language, but rather a markup language. 
    HTML is used to structure content on a webpage, 
        but it doesn't have the ability to perform logical operations, make decisions, or store and manipulate 
        data like a programming language does.
