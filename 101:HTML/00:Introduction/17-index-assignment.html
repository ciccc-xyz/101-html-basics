            <h2>Assignment Description</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the HTML Resume Assignment! Your task is to create an online resume using HTML. Your resume should include your name, interests, date of birth, education, work experience, and a general cover letter to employers. You can add a little CSS and a little JavaScript if you have experience with them, but the focus here is HTML.</p>
            <p>Make sure to use appropriate HTML tags, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. You can refer to the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3Schools HTML tutorial</a> for guidance and inspiration.</p>
